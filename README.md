### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Tino.

I started as Project Manager a few years ago and noticed my interest in data. From there my Data Science journey took of and I got my first jobs as self-taught Data Scientist. As of today I make commerce better for everyone by supporting Shopify as Sr. Data Scientist. I like every part of Data Science, starting with engineering, alytics and statistical modelling. Over the course of the last years I got some experience in all of those topics and am happy to chat about it.
