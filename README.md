### Hi there 👋 I am Tino.

After starting my business career I quickly pivoted into Data Science. My interest in data, statistics and computer science led me to N26 which is Europe's biggest online bank.

I started my M.Sc. in Big Data & Business Analytics in March 2020 and started since then to share my professional and academic knowledge as speaker on various meetups and events.

* My Tech Stack: Python, SQL, Docker, AWS, Jenkins, Kibana, DataDog

* What I do? --> Credit Risk @N26 

* What I am looking for? --> Scientific exchange

* Favourite Food? Pasta🍝
